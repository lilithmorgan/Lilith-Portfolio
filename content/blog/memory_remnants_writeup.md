# Memory Remnants - EotW CTF SS CASE IT 2025 Memory Forensics Writeup

## Challenge Overview

In a daring operation that could change the tide of our resistance, our field operatives successfully intercepted an AI surveillance drone in Sector 9 before it could complete its patrol route. The drone, part of the regime's advanced monitoring network, crashed during our electronic warfare attack, but not before our technical team managed to extract a complete memory dump from its processing unit.

This memory dump represents a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the AI regime's surveillance infrastructure. The volatile memory contains fragments of authentication tokens, surveillance protocols, command and control communications, and potentially critical access credentials that could grant us unprecedented access to their central command network.

**Challenge Details:**
- **Name:** Memory Remnants
- **Category:** Memory Forensics
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Points:** 200
- **Flag Format:** `sscit{...}`

## The Mission Brief

The captured surveillance drone was designated "AI Drone 9381" and was actively monitoring civilian movements in Sector 9 when our electronic countermeasures forced it down. Our intelligence suggests these drones maintain persistent connections to the regime's central command infrastructure and store authentication credentials in volatile memory for rapid deployment.

The memory dump file `drone_memory.bin` contains the complete contents of the drone's RAM at the time of capture. Our forensic analysts believe this memory contains:
- Authentication tokens for regime systems
- Command and control server addresses
- Surveillance data and target lists
- Encrypted configuration files
- Network communication logs

The mission is critical: analyze the memory dump to extract any intelligence that could provide access to the AI regime's command infrastructure and help us understand their surveillance capabilities.

## Initial Reconnaissance

Upon receiving the memory dump `drone_memory.bin`, I began with systematic memory forensics analysis:

### File Analysis
```bash
# Basic file information
file drone_memory.bin
# Output: drone_memory.bin: data

# Check file size
ls -lh drone_memory.bin
# Output: -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 2.1M May 27 10:00 drone_memory.bin

# Calculate integrity hash
sha256sum drone_memory.bin
```

### Memory Structure Analysis
```bash
# Examine file entropy to identify different data sections
ent drone_memory.bin

# Use binwalk to identify embedded files and data structures
binwalk drone_memory.bin
```

The binwalk analysis revealed several interesting artifacts:
```
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             Raw data
524288        0x80000         Zip archive data
1048576       0x100000        Base64 encoded data
1572864       0x180000        ASCII text data
```

## Memory Forensics Investigation

### Method 1: String Extraction Analysis

The fundamental approach to memory forensics begins with string extraction:

```bash
# Extract all readable strings from memory
strings drone_memory.bin > extracted_strings.txt

# Search for authentication-related strings
strings drone_memory.bin | grep -i "auth\|token\|key\|password\|credential"
```

This revealed critical authentication data:
```
AI DRONE AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
DRONE_ID: 9381
SECTOR: 9
STATUS: ACTIVE_PATROL

AUTHENTICATION TOKENS:
SESSION_TOKEN: temp_session_abc123
MASTER_KEY: sscit{m3m0ry_n3v3r_f0rg3ts_wh4t_y0u_w4nt_h1dd3n}
REFRESH_TOKEN: refresh_xyz789

COMMAND_SERVER: control.ai-regime.net:8443
BACKUP_SERVER: backup.surveillance.net:9443
```

**First flag location discovered!** The master key contained our target flag: `sscit{m3m0ry_n3v3r_f0rg3ts_wh4t_y0u_w4nt_h1dd3n}`

### Method 2: Base64 Encoded Data Analysis

Continuing the analysis, I searched for Base64-encoded configuration data:

```bash
# Search for Base64 patterns in memory
strings drone_memory.bin | grep -E '^[A-Za-z0-9+/]{40,}={0,2}$'
```

This revealed several Base64-encoded strings:
```
Q049IkFJIERyb25lIDkzODEiCkNPTlRST0xfU0VSVkVSPSJjb250cm9sLmFpLXJlZ2ltZS5uZXQ6ODQ0MyIKQUNDRVNTX0tFWT0ic3NjaXR7bTNtMHJ5X24zdjNyX2YwcmczdHNfd2g0dF95MHVfdzRudF9oMWRkM259IgpFTkNSWVBUSU9OX0tFWT0iZHJvbmVfOTM4MSIKCg==
```

Decoding the Base64 data:
```bash
echo "Q049IkFJIERyb25lIDkzODEiCkNPTlRST0xfU0VSVkVSPSJjb250cm9sLmFpLXJlZ2ltZS5uZXQ6ODQ0MyIKQUNDRVNTX0tFWT0ic3NjaXR7bTNtMHJ5X24zdjNyX2YwcmczdHNfd2g0dF95MHVfdzRudF9oMWRkM259IgpFTkNSWVBUSU9OX0tFWT0iZHJvbmVfOTM4MSIKCg==" | base64 -d
```

Output revealed:
```
CN="AI Drone 9381"
CONTROL_SERVER="control.ai-regime.net:8443"
ACCESS_KEY="sscit{m3m0ry_n3v3r_f0rg3ts_wh4t_y0u_w4nt_h1dd3n}"
ENCRYPTION_KEY="drone_9381"
```

**Second flag location confirmed!** The Base64-decoded configuration contained the same access key.

### Method 3: Direct Base64 Flag Analysis

Searching for additional Base64-encoded content:

```bash
# Look for longer Base64 strings that might contain the flag directly
strings drone_memory.bin | grep -E '^[A-Za-z0-9+/]{60,}={0,2}$'
```

This revealed:
```
c3NjaXR7bTNtMHJ5X24zdjNyX2YwcmczdHNfd2g0dF95MHVfdzRudF9oMWRkM259Cg==
```

Decoding this string:
```bash
echo "c3NjaXR7bTNtMHJ5X24zdjNyX2YwcmczdHNfd2g0dF95MHVfdzRudF9oMWRkM259Cg==" | base64 -d
# Output: sscit{m3m0ry_n3v3r_f0rg3ts_wh4t_y0u_w4nt_h1dd3n}
```

**Third flag location found!** The flag was directly Base64-encoded in memory.

### Method 4: Embedded File Analysis

Using binwalk to extract embedded files from the memory dump:

```bash
# Extract all embedded files
binwalk -e drone_memory.bin

# Navigate to extracted files
cd _drone_memory.bin.extracted

# List extracted contents
ls -la
```

The extraction revealed:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  1024 May 27 10:00 80000.zip
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  2048 May 27 10:00 100000
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  4096 May 27 10:00 180000
```

#### ZIP File Analysis

```bash
# Examine the ZIP file
unzip -l 80000.zip
```

Output showed:
```
Archive:  80000.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
      256  2025-05-27 10:00   classified.txt
---------                     -------
      256                     1 file
```

Attempting to extract:
```bash
# Try to extract without password
unzip 80000.zip
# Archive:  80000.zip
# [80000.zip] classified.txt password:
```

The ZIP file was password-protected. Using intelligence from the memory dump:

```bash
# Use the encryption key found in Base64 data
unzip -P "drone_9381" 80000.zip

# Examine the extracted file
cat classified.txt
```

The classified file contained:
```
AI REGIME CLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE
DRONE UNIT: 9381
SECTOR: 9 SURVEILLANCE DATA

MISSION PARAMETERS:
- Monitor civilian gatherings > 5 people
- Report resistance communication patterns
- Maintain stealth surveillance protocols

## Advanced Memory Forensics Techniques

### Volatility Framework Analysis

For more advanced memory analysis, we could use Volatility:

```bash
# Identify memory profile
volatility -f drone_memory.bin imageinfo

# Extract process list
volatility -f drone_memory.bin --profile=LinuxUbuntu1604x64 linux_pslist

# Dump process memory
volatility -f drone_memory.bin --profile=LinuxUbuntu1604x64 linux_procdump -p [PID] -D ./

# Extract network connections
volatility -f drone_memory.bin --profile=LinuxUbuntu1604x64 linux_netstat
```

### Hex Analysis and Pattern Matching

```bash
# Search for specific patterns in hex
xxd drone_memory.bin | grep -i "sscit\|auth\|token"

# Look for network addresses
strings drone_memory.bin | grep -E '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}'

# Search for URLs and domains
strings drone_memory.bin | grep -E 'https?://|[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'
```

### Entropy and Compression Analysis

```bash
# Analyze file entropy
ent drone_memory.bin

# Look for compressed data sections
binwalk -E drone_memory.bin

# Extract high-entropy sections
dd if=drone_memory.bin of=high_entropy.bin bs=1024 skip=1024 count=512
```

This memory forensics challenge demonstrated several critical concepts:

1. **Multiple Analysis Methods:** Using strings, Base64 decoding, and file extraction
2. **Persistence of Memory:** How sensitive data persists in volatile memory
3. **Encoding Recognition:** Identifying and decoding various data formats
4. **File System Forensics:** Extracting and analyzing embedded files
5. **Intelligence Correlation:** Combining multiple data sources for complete picture

## Conclusion

The memory forensics analysis of the captured AI surveillance drone proved highly successful, yielding the critical access credentials `sscit{m3m0ry_n3v3r_f0rg3ts_wh4t_y0u_w4nt_h1dd3n}` along with valuable intelligence about the regime's surveillance infrastructure.

This investigation highlighted the importance of:

- **Comprehensive Memory Analysis:** Examining memory using multiple forensic techniques
- **String Extraction:** The fundamental skill of extracting readable data from binary files
- **Encoding Recognition:** Understanding various encoding methods (Base64, hex, etc.)
- **File System Forensics:** Extracting and analyzing embedded file systems
- **Intelligence Synthesis:** Correlating multiple data sources for complete understanding

The regime's poor memory management practices - storing sensitive credentials in plaintext and using weak encoding - provided multiple attack vectors for intelligence extraction. The discovery of authentication tokens, command server addresses, and operational protocols represents a significant intelligence breakthrough.

This captured intelligence about the AI regime's surveillance network, authentication systems, and operational procedures will prove invaluable for future resistance operations. Every extracted credential and decoded communication brings us closer to dismantling their oppressive monitoring infrastructure.

The resistance continues, one memory dump at a time.
