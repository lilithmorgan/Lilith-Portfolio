# Intercepted Transmission - EotW CTF SS CASE IT 2025 Forensics Writeup

## Challenge Overview

In the shadowy world of digital resistance against the AI regime, intelligence gathering is paramount to our survival. Our network monitoring stations have successfully intercepted a data transmission from the regime's secure communication channels. The intercepted file appears to be corrupted, but our intelligence analysts believe it contains critical information about patrol routes, access credentials, and operational security protocols.

This intercepted transmission represents a rare opportunity to gain insight into the regime's internal communications and potentially discover vulnerabilities in their security infrastructure.

**Challenge Details:**
- **Name:** Intercepted Transmission
- **Category:** Forensics
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Points:** 100
- **Flag Format:** `sscit{...}`

## The Intelligence Brief

Our signals intelligence team has been monitoring the AI regime's communication networks for weeks, waiting for the perfect opportunity to intercept sensitive data. During a routine patrol communication window, we successfully captured a data transmission labeled `transmission_23467.dat` from their encrypted channels.

Initial analysis suggests the file may have been corrupted during transmission or intentionally obfuscated to prevent unauthorized access. However, our forensic specialists believe that valuable intelligence can still be extracted from the corrupted data stream.

The mission is clear: analyze the intercepted transmission file to extract any hidden intelligence that could aid our resistance operations.

## Initial Reconnaissance

Upon receiving the intercepted file `transmission_23467.dat`, I began with standard forensic analysis procedures:

### File Identification
```bash
# Basic file information
file transmission_23467.dat
# Output: transmission_23467.dat: data

# Check file size and properties
ls -lh transmission_23467.dat
# Output: -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1.6K May 27 10:00 transmission_23467.dat

# Calculate file hash for integrity verification
sha256sum transmission_23467.dat
```

The `file` command identified the transmission as generic "data," indicating either corruption or intentional obfuscation of the file format.

### Hex Analysis
```bash
# Examine the file structure in hexadecimal
xxd transmission_23467.dat | head -10
```

The hex dump revealed interesting patterns:
```
00000000: 8f3a 2b9c 4a5f 4a46 4946 7e91 3d42 8c1f  .:+.J_JFIF~.=B..
00000010: 6b2d 9a47 f8e3 1c5b 2f8e 4d73 a6b9 0e7c  k-.G...[/.Ms...|
00000020: 3f91 8e2a 5c47 b3d2 8f1e 4a6c 9e3f 7b85  ?..*\G....Jl.?{.
```

I noticed the presence of "JFIF" at offset 6, suggesting a corrupted JPEG header, but the surrounding data appeared to be random bytes.

## Forensic Analysis

### String Extraction

The most fundamental forensic technique for analyzing unknown files is string extraction:

```bash
# Extract all readable strings from the file
strings transmission_23467.dat
```

This command revealed a treasure trove of intelligence:

```
JFIF
AI REGIME INTERNAL COMMUNICATION
TRANSMISSION ID: 23467
CLASSIFICATION: RESTRICTED
DATE: 2025-05-27 14:30:00 UTC

PATROL SCHEDULE UPDATE - SECTOR 7
=================================

Unit Alpha-7: 0600-1400 hours - Northern perimeter
Unit Beta-3: 1400-2200 hours - Eastern checkpoint
Unit Gamma-1: 2200-0600 hours - Central monitoring

SECURITY PROTOCOL CHANGES:
- Access codes rotated every 72 hours
- Biometric scanners active on all entry points
- Surveillance drones patrol every 15 minutes

OPERATIONAL NOTES:
- Resistance activity detected in Sector 12
- Increase patrols near communication towers
- Report any suspicious network traffic immediately

// Internal memo: Change access credentials weekly
// Current admin backdoor: sscit{h1dd3n_1n_pl41n_s1ght_tr4nsm1ss10n}

TRANSMISSION END
```

**Flag discovered!** Hidden in plain sight within the internal memo comments was our target: `sscit{h1dd3n_1n_pl41n_s1ght_tr4nsm1ss10n}`

### Comprehensive File Analysis

To ensure thorough analysis, I continued examining the entire file structure:

```bash
# Examine the end of the file for additional data
xxd transmission_23467.dat | tail -5
```

This revealed additional hex-encoded data at the end of the file:
```
00000600: 7373 6369 747b 6831 6464 336e 5f31 6e5f  sscit{h1dd3n_1n_
00000610: 706c 3431 6e5f 7331 6768 745f 7472 346e  pl41n_s1ght_tr4n
00000620: 736d 3173 7331 306e 7d                   sm1ss10n}
```

### Hex Decoding Analysis

The hex data at the end appeared to be ASCII-encoded text:

```bash
# Extract the hex string and decode it
tail -c 73 transmission_23467.dat | xxd -p | tr -d '\n'
# Output: 73736369747b68316464336e5f316e5f706c34316e5f73316768745f7472346e736d31737331306e7d

# Decode the hex to ASCII
echo "73736369747b68316464336e5f316e5f706c34316e5f73316768745f7472346e736d31737331306e7d" | xxd -r -p
# Output: sscit{h1dd3n_1n_pl41n_s1ght_tr4nsm1ss10n}
```

**Flag confirmed!** The hex-encoded data at the end of the file contained the same flag, providing redundancy in the intelligence extraction.

4. **Intelligence Correlation:** Connecting multiple data sources for complete picture
5. **Tool Proficiency:** Using standard forensic tools effectively

## Conclusion

The analysis of the intercepted transmission `transmission_23467.dat` proved highly successful, yielding the critical access token `sscit{h1dd3n_1n_pl41n_s1ght_tr4nsm1ss10n}` along with valuable operational intelligence about the AI regime's security protocols.

This forensic investigation highlighted the importance of:

- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Examining files using multiple techniques
- **String Extraction:** The fundamental skill of extracting readable text
- **Hex Analysis:** Understanding raw data structures and encoding
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying different data storage methods
- **Intelligence Synthesis:** Combining multiple sources for complete understanding

The regime's poor operational security practices - storing sensitive credentials in plaintext comments and using simple hex encoding - provided multiple attack vectors for intelligence extraction. This intelligence breakthrough demonstrates that even "corrupted" transmissions can yield valuable information when analyzed with proper forensic techniques.

The intercepted intelligence about patrol schedules, security protocols, and access credentials will prove invaluable for future resistance operations. Every decoded transmission brings us closer to understanding and ultimately dismantling the AI regime's oppressive surveillance network.

The resistance continues, one intercepted transmission at a time.
