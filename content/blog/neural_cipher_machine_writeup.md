# Neural Cipher Machine - EotW CTF SS CASE IT 2025 Reverse Engineering Writeup

## Challenge Overview

In a critical intelligence breakthrough, our resistance cyber warfare team has successfully intercepted a piece of AI regime neural cipher machine code during a covert operation against their infrastructure network. This Python script represents a sophisticated component of their access control system, implementing what appears to be a complex mathematical transformation algorithm used to verify access codes for critical AI infrastructure.

The intercepted code is heavily obfuscated, likely to prevent reverse engineering by resistance forces. However, if we can successfully decode this neural cipher machine and understand its verification process, we could potentially forge our own access keys and gain unprecedented entry to their secure systems.

**Challenge Details:**
- **Name:** Neural Cipher Machine
- **Category:** Reverse Engineering
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Points:** 200
- **Flag Format:** `sscit{...}`

## Initial Analysis

The intercepted file `cipher_machine.py` contains heavily obfuscated Python code with lambda functions implementing mathematical transformations. The program takes input text, applies a complex transformation, and compares it against pre-stored encrypted bytes.

### Code Structure

The obfuscated transformation algorithm revealed:
```python
transform = lambda text: [((b ^ i) + (i * 7 + 23)) % 256 ^ ((i + 13) * 5 - 3) % 256 
                          for i, b in enumerate(text.encode('utf-8'))]
```

This algorithm applies three sequential operations:
1. **Initial XOR:** `byte ^ position`
2. **Position Addition:** `(result + (position * 7 + 23)) % 256`
3. **Final XOR:** `result ^ ((position + 13) * 5 - 3) % 256`

## Reverse Engineering Process

### Algorithm Analysis

To break the cipher, I needed to reverse each operation in the opposite order:

```python
def reverse_transform(encrypted_bytes):
    """Reverse the neural cipher transformation"""
    result = bytearray()
    
    for i, encrypted_byte in enumerate(encrypted_bytes):
        # Step 1: Reverse the final XOR operation
        position_xor = ((i + 13) * 5 - 3) % 256
        intermediate = encrypted_byte ^ position_xor
        
        # Step 2: Reverse the position addition
        intermediate = (intermediate - (i * 7 + 23)) % 256
        
        # Step 3: Reverse the initial XOR with position
        original_byte = intermediate ^ i
        
        result.append(original_byte)
    
    return result.decode('utf-8')
```

### Target Data Extraction

From the obfuscated code, I extracted the target encrypted bytes:
```python
encrypted_target = [187, 19, 212, 208, 49, 244, 198, 205, 238, 164, 207, 233, 147, 187, 97, 116, 36, 32, 150, 33, 171]
```

## Exploitation

### Applying the Reverse Algorithm

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def solve_neural_cipher():
    # Target encrypted bytes from the cipher machine
    encrypted_bytes = [187, 19, 212, 208, 49, 244, 198, 205, 238, 164, 207, 233, 147, 187, 97, 116, 36, 32, 150, 33, 171]
    
    def reverse_transform(encrypted):
        result = bytearray()
        
        for i, enc_byte in enumerate(encrypted):
            # Reverse step 3: Undo final XOR
            position_xor = ((i + 13) * 5 - 3) % 256
            intermediate = enc_byte ^ position_xor
            
            # Reverse step 2: Undo position addition
            intermediate = (intermediate - (i * 7 + 23)) % 256
            
            # Reverse step 1: Undo initial XOR with position
            original_byte = intermediate ^ i
            
            result.append(original_byte)
        
        return result.decode('utf-8')
    
    # Apply reverse transformation
    solution = reverse_transform(encrypted_bytes)
    print(f"Discovered access code: {solution}")
    
    # Verify by applying forward transformation
    def forward_transform(text):
        return [((b ^ i) + (i * 7 + 23)) % 256 ^ ((i + 13) * 5 - 3) % 256 
                for i, b in enumerate(text.encode('utf-8'))]
    
    verification = forward_transform(solution)
    match = verification == encrypted_bytes
    
    print(f"Verification: {match}")
    
    if match:
        flag = f"sscit{{{solution}}}"
        print(f"Flag: {flag}")
        return flag
    
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_neural_cipher()
```

### Results

Running the reverse algorithm on the encrypted bytes:
- **Discovered access code:** `n3ur4l_c1ph3r_br34k3r`
- **Verification:** Successful
- **Flag:** `sscit{n3ur4l_c1ph3r_br34k3r}`

## Technical Analysis

### Mathematical Properties

The transformation algorithm uses position-dependent operations that create a unique transformation for each byte based on its position in the input string. This makes the cipher more complex than simple substitution but still mathematically reversible.

### Vulnerability Assessment

1. **Deterministic Algorithm:** No randomness or secret keys
2. **Reversible Operations:** All mathematical operations can be inverted
3. **Position Dependency:** While adding complexity, the pattern is predictable
4. **No Cryptographic Strength:** Based on simple arithmetic rather than proven cryptographic primitives

### Alternative Solution Methods

```python
# Brute force approach (for educational purposes)
def brute_force_approach(encrypted_bytes, max_length=25):
    import string
    from itertools import product
    
    charset = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + '_'
    
    for length in range(1, max_length):
        for candidate in product(charset, repeat=length):
            test_string = ''.join(candidate)
            if forward_transform(test_string) == encrypted_bytes:
                return test_string
    
    return None
```

## Security Implications

This challenge demonstrates several important security concepts:

1. **Obfuscation vs. Security:** Code obfuscation does not provide cryptographic security
2. **Algorithm Analysis:** Understanding mathematical transformations is key to reverse engineering
3. **Custom Cryptography Risks:** Implementing custom cipher algorithms without cryptographic expertise leads to vulnerabilities
4. **Verification Importance:** Always verify reverse algorithms against known test cases

## Prevention and Mitigation

To improve the security of such systems:

```python
# Secure alternative using proper cryptography
import hashlib
import hmac
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

def secure_cipher(text, key):
    """Proper cryptographic implementation"""
    f = Fernet(key)
    return f.encrypt(text.encode())

def secure_verify(encrypted_data, key, expected_plaintext):
    """Secure verification process"""
    f = Fernet(key)
    try:
        decrypted = f.decrypt(encrypted_data).decode()
        return decrypted == expected_plaintext
    except:
        return False
```

## Conclusion

The reverse engineering analysis of the AI regime's neural cipher machine proved highly successful through systematic algorithm analysis and mathematical reversal. The challenge highlighted the importance of understanding obfuscated code, mathematical transformations, and the weaknesses inherent in custom cryptographic implementations.

Key takeaways:
- **Systematic Approach:** Breaking down complex algorithms into understandable components
- **Mathematical Analysis:** Understanding the properties of transformation functions
- **Verification Testing:** Confirming solutions through practical testing
- **Security Assessment:** Identifying fundamental cryptographic weaknesses

The extracted access code `n3ur4l_c1ph3r_br34k3r` and flag `sscit{n3ur4l_c1ph3r_br34k3r}` represent a significant intelligence victory against the AI regime's security infrastructure.

The resistance continues, one algorithm at a time.
